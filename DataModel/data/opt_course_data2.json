Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application.The course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns.

Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure & conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.Whereas the first part presents \"default\" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions",

	"description": "This course aims to provide students with the skills necessary to successfully commercialise ideas. Whilst some aspects of entrepreneurship can be learned from others, research on entrepreneurship education has shown a learn-by-doing approach is most effective. Thus, the course has a strong experiential-learning focus and will incorporate a flipped-classroom model with weekly online topics based on the Lean LaunchPad, which is used by leaders in this space such as Stanford, Berkley and the University of Pennsylvania.During their project, students form small teams, identify potential business opportunities and utilise enquiry based learning to assess the viability of their business model. Upon completion of their project, students pitch their business model and report on their learnings",
